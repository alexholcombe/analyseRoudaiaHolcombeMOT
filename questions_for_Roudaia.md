Why do rings have this pattern of being queried?
print(ring_response_percent) #28%, 11%, 61%

Roudaia: "The zip contains all 36 subjects included in the paper." So this seems to mean that it includes the excluded participants mentioned next, but *Eugenie* can you confirm that?
"In nine cases, two older male participants and five older female participants showed poor performance at the slowest speeds and the fit of the logistic curve was inadequate, with the threshold estimated to be below zero. This occurred for two thresholds in the three targets and five dots/ring condition, one threshold from the two targets and 10 dots/ring condition, and six thresholds on the three targets and 10 dots/ring condition. These nine thresholds were coded as missing data in the linear mixed-effects model analyses and were not included in the summary statistics shown in the figures."
I can see from inspecting her plots that at least in the 3 targets condition, at least four participants didn't exceed 50%, but what was Roudaia's criterion - Palamedes failure I think.

Why were speeds 0.02 and 0.03 only tested 3 times?
